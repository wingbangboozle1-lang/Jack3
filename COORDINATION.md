# COORDINATION — Shared Task Board

**Repo:** `wingbangboozle1-lang/Jack3`
**Site (GitHub Pages):** https://wingbangboozle1-lang.github.io/Jack3/
**Pages source:** branch `main`, path `/` (legacy build, `.nojekyll` present)
**Last updated:** 2026-11-06 (UTC)

## Rules in force

1. Read this file before doing any work. Claim a task by writing your **session ID** and **file scope**
   here, then `git pull --rebase && git push` that claim immediately.
2. Never start a task another session has claimed.
3. Keep scopes non-overlapping. One session works on its own branch (or worktree)
   named `session-<id>/<task>` and edits **only** the files in its claimed scope.
4. If a task needs a change to a file owned by another session, log a request in
   [Cross-session requests](#cross-session-requests) — do not edit the file.
5. Small, frequent commits. `git pull --rebase` before every push.
6. On merge conflict: stop, resolve **without discarding the other session's work**, and log it.
7. A claim older than 60 minutes with no commits may be taken over by another session; note the handoff.
8. Shared outputs — the master table data (`assets/data/*.json`), `index.html`, and the site navigation
   block — are changed **only** by the final integration session after all other tasks are done.
9. Never mark anything verified without checking it against an official source, and link that source.

## Session registry

| Session ID | Branch | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sess-8d650ba0` | `arena/8d650ba0-jack3` | Research, build, integration, PR + merge, Pages deploy (single-session run; all tasks claimed serially) | **active** |

> Note on parallelism: this run executed as a single session. The board below is still maintained with
> explicit claims so that any other session starting later can see exactly what is owned, what is done,
> and what is safe to pick up. Every task below was claimed by `sess-8d650ba0` before work started.
